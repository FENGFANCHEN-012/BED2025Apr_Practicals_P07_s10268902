For example:
Look at the code in the final app.js file (where all logic is in routes and no validation). How easy or difficult is it to read and understand 
what's happening in each route handler compared to when the database logic was in separate functions?

When all the logic is written directly inside the route handlers (like in the final app.js), it becomes harder to read and maintain. Each route
 contains multiple concerns — HTTP handling, database queries, error handling — all mixed together. This makes the file long, cluttered, and harder to debug or reuse code.
In contrast, when logic (like database queries) is placed into separate functions or modules, the route handlers become cleaner and easier to understand.
 You can read one line like createBook(data) and instantly know what it's doing — and go to the function definition if needed.


If you found a bug in how books are created in the database, which version of app.js would make it easiest to isolate and fix that bug?
The version where the database logic is separated into its own function would make it much easier to isolate and fix the bug. You can go
 directly to the createBook() function (or whatever helper handles book creation), test just that part, and fix it without touching the rest of the app.
Having all logic in one big app.js file means you have to scroll through everything, and you risk accidentally breaking other routes while debugging.

Did you face any challenges while implementing this practical?
Yes, I faced challenges with the SQL syntax and using parameterized queries correctly. For example, I had a typo in sql.Int and got confusing errors when
 using sql.query() instead of preparing the request properly with request.query(). I also had to learn how to use Postman correctly to send PUT and DELETE requests with the right URL and body.
These challenges helped me understand the importance of error messages, proper syntax, and separating logic for clarity.

(i) Why is dbConfig required?
dbConfig stores the configuration (host, username, password, database name, etc.) needed to connect to the SQL Server. Without it, the sql.connect() function wouldn’t know where or how to connect.

(ii) Purpose of async and await:
async marks a function as asynchronous, allowing it to use await and return a promise.

await pauses the function execution until the awaited promise (e.g., sql.connect) resolves, making code easier to read and write without using .then() chaining.

(iii) Why use asynchronous operations?
Because database queries take time. Using asynchronous operations ensures the server remains non-blocking and responsive while waiting for the database response.
